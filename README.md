# Diffusion models for deblending

## Matt Sampson 2022 - Semester 1 2022 Fall project
### Background info
This project will be tied into work with SCARLET (developed by P Melchior) https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018A&C....24..129M. Scarlet deblends images reducing noise and interactions from independant galaxies.

We may approach the task of deblending through the lens of probabilistic machine learning. 

and is meant to update the neural network priors we published here: https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019arXiv191203980L/abstract
## Project Aims

Galaxy images from large surveys will onclude many blended images. Performing a deblending of these is not trivial.
One approach
