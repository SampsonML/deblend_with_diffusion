# Diffusion models for deblending

## Matt Sampson 2022 - Semester 1 2022 Fall project
### Background info
This project will be tied into work with SCARLET (developed by P Melchior) https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018A&C....24..129M. Scarlet deblends images reducing noise and interactions from independant galaxies.

and is meant to update the neural network priors we published here: https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019arXiv191203980L/abstract
## Project Aims

Galaxy images from large surveys will onclude many blended images. Performing a deblending of these is not trivial.
